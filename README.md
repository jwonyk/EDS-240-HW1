# Homework #1 (Interpreting `{ggplot2}` Code: UFO Sightings)

## Purpose of this project

This project involves interpreting, explaining, and reflecting on `{ggplot2}` code used to visualize UFO sightings data. The primary objective is to deconstruct existing data visualizations to understand how specific aesthetic mappings and geometric layers contribute to the final graphic representation of the TidyTuesday dataset. This repository contains the `HW1.qmd` template file, necessary for completing HW #1. Find the full assignment description on the [course website](https://eds-240-data-viz.github.io/course-materials/assignments/HW1.html).

## Data Access

This project utilizes the UFO Sightings dataset (June 20, 2023) provided by the TidyTuesday project. The data is derived from the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC).

#### UFO Sightings Data

This dataset includes records of UFO sightings including location, date/time, shape of the craft, and duration. The data covers various global regions but focuses heavily on North American reports. The data can be accessed via the TidyTuesday [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday).
